- i was trying to change the columns names as they were not displaying a proper name for the columns and i was having issues with this column as 'im getting on borderlands and i will murder you all , as i was tryingg to change it but and the en dof the coulmn there was a space and a coma that i was not adding to this code data = data.rename(columns={'im getting on borderlands and i will murder you all ,' : 'Comments'})

- 
- Checked for missing comments and dropped any missing values to ensure all comments are available for classification.
- Added a pie chart to the notebook to visually represent the distribution of comments categorized as negative, positive, neutral, and irrelevant.

- Converted `comments` and `emotional` columns into numerical data, as multinomial Na√Øve Bayes only processes numerical data, requiring string-based sentiment data to be transformed.
